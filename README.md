💼 Compiler engineer in [Suzhou Tongyuan](https://github.com/Suzhou-Tongyuan).

I work on language runtime ⚙️ and semantics engineering 💬 for [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org).

There are programming languages I craft for faith:

* 🚣 [RowScript](https://github.com/rowscript/rowscript): A JavaScript dialect that types and compiles.
* ➗ [TinyLean](https://github.com/anqur/TinyLean): Lean-like theorem prover in less than 1K lines of Python.
* ♻️ [Reussir](https://github.com/SchrodingerZhu/reussir-lang): Functional programming meets performance.
